# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Make the “What to Do If You’ve Been Scammed” guidance explicitly include the cybercrime helpline number 1930 as a clear reporting option.

**Planned changes:**
- Update the “What to Do If You’ve Been Scammed” help content to prominently mention calling/reporting via the cybercrime helpline number “1930” in a relevant reporting-focused section (e.g., “Report to Authorities” and/or “Resources & Evidence Collection”).
- Ensure the added text is clear English, visible on the Help/What-to-do page, and does not add any external links or integrations.

**User-visible outcome:** Users reading the Help/What-to-do guidance will clearly see “1930” listed as an official helpline/reporting option when they are directed to report the scam.
